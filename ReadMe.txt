This repository contains the script used to calculate the radius of curavture for the first Positron track ever captured. All the script requires is an image of the particle's track and it perform the fit.  It is recommended that the image used for the circular fitting is either the top arc or bottom arc isolated from the rest of the image. The isolation allows for less noise during fitting and provides a more representative fit. Additionally, a script to calcualte the error associated with the choice of the pixel value parameter is included.
