This repository contains the script used to calculate the radius of curavture for the particle's track.
All the script requires is an image of the particle's track and it perform the fit. 
It is recommended that the image used for the track fitting is either the top arc or bottom arc isolated from the rest of the image.
The isolation allows for less noise during fitting and provides a more representative fit.
